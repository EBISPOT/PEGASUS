## 📖 Understanding PEG  
Identifying the genes that impact disease risk is the ultimate goal of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), since the genes and their products offer the most direct clues into biological mechanisms and are the targets of most therapies. Increasingly, as the final step of a GWAS researchers now integrate multiple kinds of genetic and genomic evidence to prioritize genes near each genetic association signal and predict which is likely to be the causal, or “effector,” gene. 

PEG is 

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genomic regions (loci) where genetic variation is significantly associated with risk of a disease or magnitude of a trait
Most GWAS variants are outside of protein-coding regions and impact regulation of nearby genes
To predict which gene near a GWAS locus is the most likely effector gene, researchers aggregate and integrate multiple types of evidence
Effector gene prediction is a major output of post-GWAS analyses
