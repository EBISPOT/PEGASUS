# 🌏 Shaping Together: PEG Workshop 2024 → ASHG 2025  

In September 2024, we hosted a workshop on Predicted Effector Gene (PEG) lists — key data for linking GWAS signals to biology.

Talks from the Knowledge Portal Network, Open Targets, GWAS Catalog, ClinGen, and others sparked ideas we are carrying forward.

We explored:  
- 🔑 Different approaches to building PEG lists  
- 🔑 Challenges in sharing, updating, and reusing them  
- 🔑 First steps toward a community standard for reporting PEG data  

👉 Missed it? Materials & recordings are available: [Workshop Materials](https://kp4cd.org/2024_PEG_workshop)  

Follow along as we count down to ASHG 2025, where we’ll share the outcomes through our poster and ancillary session.  

📍 **Save the date in Boston:**  
- 🗓️ Ancillary Session: Oct 17 | 11:45 am – 1:15 pm | Room 259A  
- 📌 Poster: Oct 16 | 2:30 pm – 4:30 pm | Exhibit & Poster Hall, Lower Level
