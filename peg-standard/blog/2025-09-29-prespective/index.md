# 🔍 From GWAS Hits to PEGs  

Millions of GWAS associations have been reported — but which genes are the true Predicted Effector Genes (PEGs)?  

In April 2025, our **Nature Genetics Perspective** (with the GWAS Catalog) reviewed 169 publications (2012–2022, across 157 traits).  

### What did we learn?  
⚡ PEG prediction methods are highly inconsistent  
⚡ Evidence types and reporting standards vary widely  
⚡ The field urgently needs a common PEG standard  

### What’s next?  
At **ASHG 2025**, we’re bringing a new PEG standard designed to make PEG data **FAIR** — Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
