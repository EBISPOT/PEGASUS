# ðŸ§¬ PEGASUS Framework Documentation
This repository hosts the documentation for **PEGASUS** â€” the Predicted Effector Gene Annotation and Standardization framework.

PEGASUS provides a structured approach for reporting and sharing **Predicted Effector Gene (PEG)** information through a **reusable evidence matrix** and a **ready-to-use PEG list** that summarizes integrated conclusions across evidence treams.

The framework is being co-developed through a collaborative effort between the **European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)** and the **Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard**, together with contributions from our wider PEG working group members.
